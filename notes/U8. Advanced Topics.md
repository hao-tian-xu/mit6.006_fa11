## Definitions

- ${\mathrm{P}}=\left\{\right.$ problems solvable in polynomial $\left(n^{c}\right)$ time $\}$ (what this class is all about)
- $\mathrm{EXP}=\left\{\right.$ problems solvable in exponential $\left(2^{n^{c}}\right)$ time $\}$
- ${\mathrm{R}}=\{$ problems solvable in finite time $\}$ "recursive" [Turing 1936; Church 1941]

## Most Decision Problems are Uncomputable

- program $\approx$ (finite?) binary string $\approx$ nonneg. integer $\in N$
- decision problem $=$ a function from binary strings $(\approx$ nonneg. integers) to $\{\mathrm{YES}(1)$, $\mathrm{NO}(0)\}$
- $\approx$ infinite sequence of bits $\approx$ real number $\in \mathbb{R}$
$|\mathbb{N}| \ll|\mathbb{R}|:$ no assignment of unique nonneg. integers to real numbers $(\mathbb{R}$ uncountable)
- $\Longrightarrow$ not nearly enough programs for all problems
- each program solves only one problem
- $\Longrightarrow$ almost all problems cannot be solved

## NP

Non-deterministic Polynomial

NP = {Decision problems solvable in polynomial time via a “lucky” algorithm}. The “lucky” algorithm can make lucky guesses, always “right” without trying all options. 

- nondeterministic model: algorithm makes guesses & then says YES or NO 
- guesses guaranteed to lead to YES outcome if possible (no otherwise) 

In other words, NP = {decision problems with solutions that can be “checked” in polynomial time}. This means that when answer = YES, can “prove” it & polynomial-time algorithm can check proof

## $\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{N P}$

Big conjecture (worth $\$ 1,000,000)$

- $\approx$ cannot engineer luck
- $ \approx$ generating (proofs of) solutions can be harder than checking them

## Hardness and Completeness

Tetris is $\underline{\text { NP-hard }}=$ "as hard as" every problem $\in$ NP. In fact $\underline{\text { NP-complete }}=\mathrm{NP} \cap \mathrm{NP}$-hard.

## Reductions

Convert your problem into a problem you already know how to solve (instead of solving from scratch)
- most common algorithm design technique
- unweighted shortest path $\rightarrow$ weighted (set weights $=1$ )
- min-product path $\rightarrow$ shortest path (take logs) [PS6-1]
- longest path $\rightarrow$ shortest path (negate weights) [Quiz 2, P1k]
- shortest ordered tour $\rightarrow$ shortest path $(k$ copies of the graph) [Quiz 2, P5]
- cheapest leaky-tank path $\rightarrow$ shortest path (graph reduction) [Quiz 2, P6]

All the above are One-call reductions: A problem → B problem → B solution → A solution 

Multicall reductions: solve A using free calls to B — in this sense, every algorithm reduces problem → model of computation 

NP-complete problems are all interreducible using polynomial-time reductions (same difficulty). This implies that we can use reductions to prove NP-hardness — such as in 3-Partition → Tetris



## *Thinking*

这一讲快速介绍了可计算性和计算复杂性。几乎是纯数学的领域。其中大多数决策问题不可计算的证明如果有什么实际意义的话，会指向很有趣的讨论。

## NP-Complete

Read CLRS on NP-complete, know these problems that are NP-complete, and avoid reduction to these problems in the future.

## SAT



## *Thinking*

可计算性和计算复杂度在实际应用中有重要的意义：对于需要在大数据集上运算的情况，避免无法解决或解决速度很慢（$\geq$NP-complete）的问题。
